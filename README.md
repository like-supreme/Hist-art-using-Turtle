# 🎨 Dot Painting with Python Turtle

This project generates a 10x10 grid of colorful dots using Python's built-in `turtle` module.  
Inspired by Damien Hirst’s signature dot art style, this beginner-friendly program combines Turtle graphics, loops, and random color generation to create vibrant digital artwork.

## 📸 Preview

Each run produces a new, randomized dot pattern like this:

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a **10x10 grid** of colorful dots
- Uses **RGB color mode** (`t.colormode(255)`)
- Randomized color selection from a predefined palette
- Smooth and fast drawing with `speed("fastest")`
- Pen movement without drawing lines between dots

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (standard library)
- `random` module

---

## 📁 Project Structure

project_folder/
├── main.py # Main logic for drawing the dot grid
├── image.jpg (optional) # Color palette source if using colorgram
└── README.md

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understanding and using the `turtle` graphics module
- Working with loops and coordinate systems
- Using RGB color tuples
- Drawing shapes (`dot()`, `goto()`, `penup()`, `pendown()`)

---

## 💡 Bonus Ideas

- Extract color palettes dynamically with `colorgram`
- Change grid size (e.g., 8x8, 12x12)
- Use gradients or pattern rules instead of full random
- Add interactivity (e.g., click to regenerate)

## ✅ Requirements

No installation needed if you're using Python 3 — the `turtle` module comes pre-installed!
This project was part of my Python learning journey using Turtle Graphics.
It helped me understand coordinate logic, pen control, and basic color theory in programming.
Feel free to fork, modify, or remix it!
